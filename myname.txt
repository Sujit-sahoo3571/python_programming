A beautiful mind is worth surviving in this world.
one day you will earn a nobel prize for your work
and i'm there for you and i'm always going to be 
with you see you soon.

last night i let go all the thing  i  hold in my mind
and let it aquare new things that matter to me 
i started taking care of me and make myself worthy
i donot need any one in my life alone i'm completed .
it's time to take care of yourself as this is my life 

and i know what should i do for my life and how i live my life
here thats all . :0
